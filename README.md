## User Stories
- As a user, I will be able to sign-up, sign-in, change my password and log off easily.
- I will be able to search for existing beers in the database, read information about them and rate them.
- I will be able to view my ratings from the past and edit or delete them as I see fit.

## Future User Stories
- I will be able to connect with others and see the ratings they have created.
- I will be able to add a beer on my own if it doesn't already exist in the database.

## The Project
This project was a great introduction to using Ruby on Rails and building my own back-end API as well as a great continutation of honing my skills on the front end. As an avid craft beer enthusiast, it seemed like a natural fit for my first big project to be an amalgamation of two of my greatest passions.

## Challenges
I found it challenging to build an app with my own back-end because there are so many moving parts. Eventually, with hands on practice, the skills I have learned became much more clear on a high level by applying them.

It was a tough learning curve to work with a 3rd party API. The API's that I had to choose from didn't always have the information that I thought was necessary and so I was contrained by that. In the future I will make my own Beer table and upload data from an open database as well as have users create thier own rows with beers that they input.
